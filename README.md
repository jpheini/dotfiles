dotfiles
========
This repo, for now, contains what must be my most cultivated dotfile ever, vimrc.

- Supports terminal Vim, MacVim, and GVim.
- There's and emphasis on JavaScript since that's one of my favorite languages at the moment.
- You may want to install additional tools like Ack and JSHint, and the Source Code Pro for Powerline font to get most out of the configuration.
- Note that I make use of ~/.vim directory, by placing undo files, skeleton files, and viminfo there.
