This repo contains my Spacemacs and Vim configuration files.

## spacemacs

I use Spacemacs for editing Clojure code. There's not much configuration in user-config, just a few lines that make it more convenient to use in Mac.

## vimrc

My Vim configuration is build from scratch. To think about all the work that went into configuring Vim, it is easy to respect "distributions" like Spacemacs.

My vimrc is bit unmaintained at the moment, but here it is anyway:

- Supports terminal Vim, MacVim, and GVim.
- There's emphasis on JavaScript since ~~that's one of my favorite languages at the moment~~ it's my second language of choice after Clojure.
- You may want to install additional tools like Ack and JSHint, and the Source Code Pro for Powerline font to get most out of the configuration.
- Note that I make use of ~/.vim directory, by placing undo files, skeleton files, and viminfo there.
